S.A.M. Project 

IN PROGRESS

This project is utilizes python within the terminal to generate a voice-activated virtual assistant that can help you stay productive with things like, telling the time and date, giving brief Wikipedia page summaries, keeping a to-do list for you and much more.

The script utilizes the pyttsx3 python module for basic text to speech functions that the script uses as its output (that's the little guy that talks to you!)

Listening is done with the Speech Recognition module in python and can be a bit finicky (F.Y.I.)

There are certain buzzwords that will activate functions to complete the various tasks I listed earlier. I will give a brief guide below. If no buzzword is found the program will loop back the beginning and will listen again for the following 30 seconds.

"time" will give you the time
"date" will give you the date
"search" will begin the wiki_search function
"joke" will tell a joke
"to do list" will activate the todo list function
"stop" or "shutdown" will stop the program 

This project is still a work in progress and will continuously receive updates over time
